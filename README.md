# Kickstarter-Analysis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends


## Overview of Project
Using data about various types of entertainment to find trends that separate successful and failed projects. 
### Purpose
To determine what factors can show us the most about what leads to success and what tends to lead to failures regarding time of release and financial goal.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
- I did not run into any major challenges with this exercise within excel. I did have a hard time with the graphs wanting to disappear, formatting and getting things into Gitlab. I am hoping I have followed instructions well enough in doing so but have a feeling there will be some corrections that need made as far as presenting a clean depository.


## Results
- As for results of our data raging the launch date.
The greatest rate of successful plays come out in the early summer and that number drops off significantly in the fall going into the beginning of the year.

- Looking into the data we observed regarding outcomes based on goals.
When judging the success of plays based on their financial goal, the plays with a goal in the ranges of 1000 - 15000 as well as 35000 to 40000, with plays of other goals between and above those ranges showing a higher number failing to reach their goal than successfully reaching it. Particularly at the 45000 mark and above showing very few successful.


- Limitations of this data set.
The two factors we dug into were time of release and financial goal. There are many other factors we could look at to determine success rate. Many other factors could be considered when creating a new play or film to break it down further included with this data such as genre and target audience for one example.

# What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
- Other factors that could have been considered are number of backers as it would seen likely that would positivley correspond to the success rate. Another could be average donation which would seem that the higher that average is the more likely for success. However that may not outweigh projects with lots of smaller donations. Whether or not it was a staff pick or spotlight could also be worth comparing.
